# HTC-Vive Setup Guide {#htc-vive-setup-guide}



\(NOTE: If at any time during the process you do not know what is going on, contact Sean Hauze or someone else in the FIT Center that is familiar with this process.\)

**Launching Steam:**

\(Steam is the application that houses all of the virtual reality applications\)

1\) Double-click the Steam icon found on the Desktop

\(NOTE: Steam may ask for the login credentials. In this case, contact Sean Hauze to gain access.\)

**Launching a VR Application:**

1\) Navigate to the Library tab within Steam \(the word "LIBRARY" will be highlighted white when you are in the tab

2\) Select an application to Launch

\(We will be adding countless VR applications as we begin to work with more and more faculty. For more information on what applications to choose/what each app entails, contact Sean Hauze or someone else in the FIT center who with VR experience.\)

3\) Preparing the input devices

There are 5 key components to the VIVE; in order from left to right in the image below they are: The head piece, the left and right hand controller, and the two base stations.

The system should automatically recognize all of the active components of the VIVE, upon launching an application this window should appear:

If your window matches this \(excluding "TheLab.exe"\) you are good to go.

\(NOTE: If your pop-up window does not match this, you must do additional steps to ensure everything is working before enter Virtual Reality.\)

Troubleshooting:

IF YOU SEE:

This means that one of your base stations is not registering the head piece

How to fix:

Make sure that the head piece is within sight of both bases \(mounted on the ceiling above the computer\). The bases must both be able to see the head piece to see two green bases on the pop-up window.

IF YOU SEE:

This means that your handheld controllers are not connected

How to fix:

Make sure that the controllers are turned on by pressing the concave button underneath the large circular trackpad on each controller; doing so should result in a green light directly under the concave button.

IF YOU SEE:

This means that the head piece is not being registered

How to fix:

Make sure that the headpiece is plugged into the computer via rectangular brick in the computer cabinet. If everything seems to be plugged in, contact Sean Hauze to troubleshoot.

**HAVE FUN:**

Be careful. When in the VR world, you will not be able to see anything aside outside the head piece. Make sure to be wary of the blue grid that appears when you walk to close to a boundary, they are there to ensure that you do not hurt yourself on the real environment around you.

Be sure to set a timer. All sense of time and other real world concepts go out the window when in the virtual world. Be sure to set a timer so you do not end up getting lost in the virtual space for hours.

Give feedback. This Virtual Reality project runs off the studies and feedback from individuals in the virtual space. After using virtual reality, contact Sean Hauze at shauze@mail.sdsu.edu with comments and assisted learning ideas to keep this wonderful project going.
