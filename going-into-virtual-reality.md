**Be careful.** When in the VR world, you will not be able to see anything aside outside the head piece. Make sure to be wary of the blue grid that appears when you walk to close to a boundary, they are there to ensure that you do not hurt yourself on the real environment around you.

**Be sure to set a timer.** All sense of time and other real world concepts go out the window when in the virtual world. Be sure to set a timer so you do not end up getting lost in the virtual space for hours.

**Give feedback.** This Virtual Reality project runs off the studies and feedback from individuals in the virtual space. After using virtual reality, contact Sean Hauze at shauze@mail.sdsu.edu with comments and assisted learning ideas to keep this wonderful project going.
